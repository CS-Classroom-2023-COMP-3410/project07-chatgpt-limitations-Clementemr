The changes I made are that there is now a "player _'s turn" displayed at the top of the matching game. It switches each time a player gets a match wrong and increments when they get a match right. A player is able to keep getting consecutive matches right. It keeps score of how many matches each player has gotten and at the end there is a javascript alert saying who won or if there is a draw. I believe this satisfies all of the requirements of the new feature. Chatgpt did most of the work and only required a few edits from me.
